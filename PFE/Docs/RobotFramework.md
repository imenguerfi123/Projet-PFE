<h2>What is RobotFramework?</h2>

RobotFramework is a GENERIC test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATTD). What it means that you can do web, mobile, desktop and other test automation activities with related test libraries. 

These libraries can be implemented either with Python or with Java, and we can add new higher-level keywords from existing ones. It has also very easy test data syntax that utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach.

RobotFramework project is hosted on GitHub where you can find further documentation, source code, and issue tracker. The core framework is implemented using Python and runs on Jython (JVM) and IronPython (.NET).

RobotFramework itself is open source software released under Apache License 2.0, and most of the libraries and tools in the ecosystem are open source.

<h2>RobotFramework Architecture</h2>

♦ When test execution is started, the framework first parses the test data.

♦ It then utilizes keywords provided by the test libraries to interact with the system under test.

♦ Libraries can communicate with the system either directly or using other test tools as drivers.

♦ Test execution is started from the command line. As a result, you get report and log in HTML format as well as an XML output. These provide extensive look into what your system does.
