***********************************************How to access UART using Python *****************************************


1) Free the serial port

Before going further, you must check that the console is not listening on the serial port. To do this, run

          sudo raspi-config

	  Select -> Interfacing Options

          select Serial option to enable UART

          Then it will ask for login shell to be accessible over Serial, select No shown as follows.

          At the end, it will ask for enabling Hardware Serial port, select Yes.

          Finally, our UART is enabled for Serial Communication on RX and TX pin of Raspberry Pi 3.


2) reboot the Raspberry Pi.


3)Install pyserial 

Pyserial provides backend for serial communication using python. The module named ‘serial’ selects appropriate backend automatically. 
To install pySerial, by using following command.


          sudo pip3 install pyserial

          sudo apt-get install python-serial python3-serial


And in case you don't have working internet connection on Raspberry Pi

1) download the PySerial package  

           https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/

2) cd pyserial-3.4 

           sudo python setup.py install
